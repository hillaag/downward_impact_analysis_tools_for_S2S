# process_cyc_freq_anom

This code is for scientific processing and analysis of netCDF data. 
It is used for analysis of the surface response to extreme events in Earth's stratosphere (known as weak and strong vortex states) in two types of datasets:
* ECMWF forecasts issued for the S2S (Subseasonal to seasonal) prediction ongoing research project (https://www.ecmwf.int/en/research/projects/s2s)
* ERA-5 reanalysis
#
---------------------------------------

## Required data:
* Extratropical cyclone frequency in ensemble forecasts
* Extratropical cyclone frequency in ERA-5
